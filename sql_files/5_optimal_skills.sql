     INSIGHTS
     Python and SQL remain foundationalâ€”widely used and well-paid.
     
     Snowflake, Looker, and Azure are less common but very lucrative, suggesting a strong edge if you're certified or experienced in them.
     
     Visualization tools like Tableau and Looker also carry weight in both salary and demand.*/
